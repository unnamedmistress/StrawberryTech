# Hallucinations Game Improvements

The existing "Hallucinations" quiz challenges players to spot a single AI-generated lie among two factual statements. Below are ideas for making the game more engaging and incorporating generative AI for unique learning opportunities.

## Gameplay Enhancements

1. **Adaptive Difficulty** – Adjust the number of statements or complexity of facts based on the player's score or age.
2. **Timed Rounds** – Introduce a countdown to increase pressure and urgency.
3. **Streak Bonuses** – Reward consecutive correct answers with multiplier points.
4. **Leaderboards** – Display global rankings so players can compare points.
5. **Hint System** – Offer limited hints that narrow down options but reduce potential points.
6. **Daily Challenges** – Provide a new set of questions every day to encourage repeat visits.
7. **Score Sharing** – Allow users to share results on social media.
8. **Achievement Badges** – Unlock badges for milestones like flawless rounds or quick responses.
9. **Progressive Reveal** – After each question, show a short explanation of the true and false statements to reinforce learning.
10. **Community Submissions** – Let players propose question sets that get reviewed before appearing in the game.

## Leveraging Generative AI

- **Dynamic Question Generation** – Use the OpenAI API to create fresh sets of statements so each round feels unique.
- **Age‑Targeted Content** – Generate questions tailored to different age groups for appropriate difficulty and subject matter.
- **Explanatory Feedback** – Ask the model to provide concise explanations of why the hallucination is wrong.
- **Hint Generation** – On request, the AI can produce subtle hints that help players analyze statements without giving away the answer.
- **Content Expansion** – Generate new facts from various domains (science, history, culture) so players learn a broader range of knowledge.

These improvements can make the Hallucinations game more challenging, replayable, and educational while preserving the existing layout and style.
