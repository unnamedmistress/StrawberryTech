# Generative Escape Room Concepts

Below are ten ways generative AI can enhance the Clarity Escape Room experience:

1. **Prompt Paraphrasing** – Accept different phrasings for the same intent using an AI scoring function.
2. **Creative Suggestions** – Offer optional hints generated on demand when a player gets stuck.
3. **Dynamic Storytelling** – Generate short scene descriptions after each door unlocks.
4. **Adaptive Difficulty** – Rate player inputs and adjust timer lengths or required score.
5. **Vocabulary Expansion** – Provide synonyms to encourage varied language in prompts.
6. **Mini Lessons** – Summarize best practices after each successful door unlock.
7. **AI Narrator** – Use a chat box to describe the room or provide flavor text.
8. **Speech Input** – Transcribe voice commands and feed them to the AI evaluator.
9. **Achievement Messages** – Generate personalized congratulations based on the player name.
10. **End‑of‑Game Recap** – Summarize how well the player used clear prompts.
