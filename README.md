# StrawberryTech Learning Games

StrawberryTech is a collection of small web games built with **React**, **TypeScript** and **Vite**. Each game adapts content based on the player's age, which is stored locally so progress persists between sessions.

## Mini Games

### Tone Puzzle
Swap adjectives to explore how word choice affects tone. Matches award points and may show leadership tips that vary by age group. Scores and badges are saved for later.

### Hulluscinations
A short quiz where you spot the single AI hallucination hidden among two truthful statements.

## Ageâ€‘Adaptive Features
- Players enter their age and name on first visit.
- Games read the stored age to tweak difficulty and show tailored tips.
- High scores and earned badges persist using `localStorage`.

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies and start the dev server:
   ```bash
   cd learning-games
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
2. Create a `.env` file inside `learning-games` with your
   `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=<your key>` for the Robot chat feature.
3. Open the printed URL in your browser.

Node **18+** is recommended. Major dependencies include React 19, React Router 7, Vite 6 and TypeScript. Toast notifications are provided by `react-hot-toast` and unit tests use `vitest`.

## Development Tips
- `npm run lint` checks code style with ESLint.
- `npm run test` runs the Vitest unit tests.
- `npm run build` creates a production build in `dist/`.

### Running Tests

Before executing the test suite make sure dependencies are installed:

```bash
cd learning-games
npm install
npm test
```

Without installing the packages first the `vitest` command used by
`npm test` will not be available and the tests will fail.

## Environment Variables
RobotChat uses the OpenAI API. Create a `.env` file inside `learning-games` containing:

```bash
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key
```

Without this key, the RobotChat feature will not work.
